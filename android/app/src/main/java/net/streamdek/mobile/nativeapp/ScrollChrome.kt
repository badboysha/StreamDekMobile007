 * A page header that makes room while the viewer scrolls, and keeps its search field.

 * # What it does
 *
 * Scrolling down, the header's other parts (title, subtitle, filters) condense away in a staggered
 * sequence while the header slides up to leave only the search field at the top. The surface behind
 * follows: in the Modern style the glass panel closes into a floating pill around the field; in the
 * Default style the opaque band tightens to hug it. Scrolling back up plays the same choreography in
 * reverse, rebuilding outward from the field.
 *
 * The part that stays is whatever the content marks as its anchor: the search field on a search page,
 * the title row on a library page. A header with no anchor ([keepAnchorVisible] false) slides away
 * whole.
 *
 * # What it costs
 *
 * Nothing on the page moves: the header's slot keeps its size, so the list underneath never
 * re-measures. Every animated value is read in a placement, layout or graphics-layer lambda (the
 * slide is a re-placement, the morph a re-layout of one surface node, the stagger a layer property),
 * so a scrolled frame recomposes nothing. The moving parts are placed rather than translated,
 * because the glass works out what to blur from where it is placed.
 *
 * Put the clip edge where the header should disappear: [modifier] is applied outside the clip, so a
 * caller passes the status-bar padding there and the header tucks under the status bar rather than
 * sliding over its icons.
