/**
 * Client-side funnel telemetry.
 *
 * The backend can see which add-ons it queried and which debrid providers it tried, but not
 * whether anything ever played — that only happens on the device. Without these events the
 * admin console can report that sources were resolved and still not answer "did it work",
 * which is the question that matters.
 *
 * Three rules shape this:
 *
 *  - It must never affect playback. Every path is wrapped, the queue is bounded, failures are
 *    swallowed, and nothing is ever awaited from the UI. Losing telemetry is acceptable;
 *    delaying a stream is not.
 *  - It must never report something it does not know. An event is only emitted where the
 *    outcome is actually established — a source that failed and was retried successfully is
 *    not a playback failure, and is not recorded as one.
 *  - It carries no content beyond the media id and title the catalogue already exposes. No
 *    stream URLs, no magnets, no credentials.
